# App Center Command Line Interface (CLI)

Visual Studio App Center command line interface (CLI) is a unified tool for running App Center services from the command line.
Our aim is to offer a concise and powerful tool for our developers to use App Center services and easily script a sequence of
commands that they'd like to execute. You can currently login and view/configure all the apps that you have access to in App Center.

## Prerequisites

The required Node.js version is 18 or higher, 
Mono and the Android-SDK are required to run the UI test for Android and iOS.

## Installation

```
npm install --location=global appcenter-cli
```

Once installed, use the `appcenter` command. See below for the available commands.

## Getting Help

To get a top level list of the available commands, run `appcenter help`.

To get help on a specific command or category, run `appcenter help command` or pass the `-h` flag to any command or category name.

App Center provides SDK support directly within the App Center portal. Any time you need help, just sign in to [App Center](https://appcenter.ms), then choose **'Contact support'** inside the help menu on the upper right of the App Center portal and our dedicated support team will respond to your questions and feedback.
